# My Pal CASEY (Cool Ass Sports and Entertainment Yapper)

This is a pet project of mine. Casey is meant to be an information source for those involved in the sports and entertainment worlds. Casey will learn about sports (players, teams, games) and entertainment (music, artists, pop culture) through various apis. 

## Structure

This program is split into two parts: the ui and the web app. The ui is a Typescript based React app. The web app is a Python FastAPI.

## Developer

The developer of Casey is [Daniel Shea](danielgshea.com)

## License

I don't have a license for that I need to learn about them first.
