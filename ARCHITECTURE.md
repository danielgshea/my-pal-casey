# Architecture

## 1. Frontend Architecture (TypeScript + React)

### React Components Structure:
- **Main Layout**: Manages general layout, including navbar, footer, etc.
- **HomePage**: Displays trending sports/news, recent queries, chatbot interface.
- **ChatComponent**: For real-time conversations with the chatbot.
- **NewsComponent**: Renders live news using API data.
- **SportsComponent**: Renders sports updates.
- **SettingsComponent**: Allows users to customize preferences (e.g., favorite teams, news sources).

### State Management:
Use React Context or Redux for global state (user preferences, API data caching).

### Routing:
React Router to handle navigation between different pages (home, news, sports, etc.).

### API Interaction:
- Fetch sports/news data from backend using axios or fetch.
- Chatbot integration: Frontend sends user inputs to the FastAPI chatbot endpoint.

## 2. Backend Architecture (FastAPI + Python)

### Main FastAPI Application:

#### API Endpoints:
- `/news`: Fetch latest news from external APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, Google News).
- `/sports`: Fetch sports data (e.g., from ESPN API).
- `/chat`: Handles chatbot requests, integrates with NLP model (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, OpenAI API).

#### Authentication:
Optional user authentication via OAuth2 (if needed for custom preferences).

### Backend Components:
- **API Clients**: Python scripts or classes to interact with external APIs (news and sports data).
- **Chatbot Logic**: Integrates with an NLP model for chatbot responses.
- **Caching Layer**: Use Redis or similar to cache frequently requested sports/news data for performance.
- **Database**: If you want to store user preferences, conversations, or historical data, you could use PostgreSQL or SQLite.

### Deployment:
Backend hosted on an EC2 instance or containerized with Docker, then deployed on AWS Fargate or EC2.

## 3. API Routes Overview

### News API Routes:
- `GET /news/latest`: Fetch the latest news.
- `GET /news/category/{category}`: Fetch news by category (e.g., sports, entertainment).
- `GET /news/search`: Search for specific news articles (query param).

### Sports API Routes:
- `GET /sports/latest`: Get the latest sports scores and news.
- `GET /sports/team/{team_name}`: Fetch info for a specific team.

### Chatbot API Routes:
- `POST /chat`: Sends a user message to the chatbot, returns response.

### User Preferences Routes (Optional):
- `POST /user/preferences`: Save user preferences for teams/news sources.
- `GET /user/preferences`: Get user preferences.

## Additional Notes:
- **Frontend Deployment**: Host on S3/CloudFront for scalability, connect it to the backend through API Gateway or directly through domain.
- **Backend Deployment**: Utilize Docker for easy deployment. You can deploy on AWS ECS (Fargate) or EC2, using a load balancer for scaling.
